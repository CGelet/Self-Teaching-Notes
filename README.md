# What is this Respository?
## Context of who I am 
My name is Colton Gelety, and as of writing this <b>(10/21/2023)</b>, I am a junior at WVU in Mechanical and Aerospace engineering. I have a high focus in aeronautics, and am looking to develop a set of notes online of different technology or topics which I wish to learn about.

As of right now, outside of classes I try to teach myself something for about an hour a day. This may be related to projects which I am current doing in class, but generally, I like to learn about topics which are completely unrelated to class work. 

## Note Topics
As previously stated, a lot of my notes are not generally guided by the requirements of my classwork, and are more or so related to my interest outside of classes. Obviously, with my current major, a lot of these will be related to some sort of mechanical or aerospace topic, but I also grew up in a family focusing a lot on electronics and general technology, so I may instead deviate towards an electronic component, software development, or some other technological topic.

## Goals of this Respository
For me, the main goal of this repository is to keep a universal, public database of the different topics in which I am looking to learn about. Rangiing from velocity potential and flow fields to database management and data science. All of these topics are generally interesting to me, so I am looking to keep a universal place of my Markdown notes where I can access from anywhere, but also where people who have an interest in the topics can use as a reference.
