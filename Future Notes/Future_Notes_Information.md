# What is this folder?
Well, I have hundreds of things running through my head at all times. I am constantly thinking of new research topics, and therefore I have created this folder to house some of the notes in which I want to research. This Markdown file will be updated periodically, but is more or so just here for insight.

There exists a folder for each genre of topic that I have interest in (from what I can think of currently), and there are a list of topics within those genres which I will evantually add to when I get to that topic.
