# State-Space Logger Information
For the Microgravity research team, the statespace logger is composed of a multitude of sensors to capture general data of the atmosphere and system post-flight. For the base logger, there is an ES(Environmental Sensor) and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). These two sensors are used to collect the following variables:
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Relative Humidity
- Acceleration
- Magnetic Field Strength
- Angular Velocity

With these three variables we can calculate a range of different characteristics that the system is currently experiencing. This document will be used to further expand on the math and programming behind getting these systems to work. A lot of these notes will be generally used for personally understanding how these systems work.
