# Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) 
IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit. It is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. IMUs are commonly used in applications such as drones, robotics, and virtual reality systems.

## Aerospace Uses
In the case of MRT we use a 9-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) IMU to capture all necessary data. a 9-DOF IMU includes an accelerometer, magnetometer, and a gyroscope, each in 3-DOF.
